    <h1>Welcome to My Digital Space</h1>

    <p>This is my little corner of the web, where I host various subdomains, experiments, and random projects.</p>
    
    <p>Each subdomain represents something unique—whether it's a fun idea, a coding experiment, or just something I'm tinkering with.</p>
    
    <p>Feel free to explore, and check back often for new additions! You can find the source for this page in <code>index.html</code>, and yes, you’re free to tweak it to your liking!</p>
